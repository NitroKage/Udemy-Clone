                    <h2>Terms</h2>
                    <p><i>These Terms were last updated July 5, 2024.</i></p>
                    <p>When you sign up to become an instructor on the Udemy platform, you agree to abide by these Instructor Terms. These Terms cover details about the aspects of the Udemy platform relevant to instructors and are incorporated by reference into our Terms of Use, the general terms that govern your use of our Services. Any capitalized terms that aren't defined in these Terms are defined as specified in the Terms of Use.</p>
                    <p>As an instructor, you are contracting directly with Udemy, Inc. (a Delaware corporation in the United States), regardless of whether another Udemy subsidiary facilitates payments to you.</p>

                    <h4>1. Instructor Obligations</h4>
                    <p>As an instructor, you are responsible for all content that you post, including lectures, quizzes, coding exercises, practice tests, assignments, resources, answers, course landing page content, labs, assessments, and announcements ("Submitted Content").</p>

                    </ul>
<p>You warrant that you will not:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>use the Services for business other than providing tutoring, teaching, and instructional services to students</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>engage in any activity that would require us to obtain licenses from or pay royalties to any third party, including the need to pay royalties for the public performance of a musical work or sound recording;</p>

                        <li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. License to Udemy</h4>
                    <p>You grant Udemy the rights detailed in the Terms of Use to offer, market, and otherwise exploit your Submitted Content. This includes the right to add captions or otherwise modify Submitted Content to ensure accessibility. You also authorize Udemy to sublicense these rights to your Submitted Content to third parties, including to students directly and through third parties such as resellers, distributors, affiliate sites, deal sites, and paid advertising on third-party platforms.</p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise agreed (including within our Promotions Policy), you have the right to remove all or any portion of your Submitted Content from the Services at any time. Except as otherwise agreed, Udemy's right to sublicense the rights in this section will terminate with respect to new users 60 days after the Submitted Content's removal. However, (1) rights given to students before the Submitted Content's removal will continue in accordance with the terms of those licenses (including any grants of lifetime access) and (2) Udemy's right to use such Submitted Content for marketing purposes shall survive termination.</p>
                    <p>We may record and use all or any part of your Submitted Content for quality control and for delivering, marketing, promoting, demonstrating, or operating the Services. You grant Udemy permission to use your name, likeness, voice, and image in connection with offering, delivering, marketing, promoting, demonstrating, and selling the Services, your Submitted Content, or Udemy's content, and you waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature, to the extent permissible under applicable law.</p>

                    <h4>3. Trust & Safety</h4>
                    <h5>3.1 Trust & Safety Policies</h5>
                    <p>You agree to abide by Udemy's Trust & Safety policies, Restricted Topics policy, and other content quality standards or policies prescribed by Udemy from time to time. You should check these policies periodically to ensure that you comply with any updates to them. You understand that your use of the Services is subject to Udemy's approval, which we may grant or deny at our sole discretion.</p>
                    <p>We reserve the right to remove content, suspend payouts, and/or ban instructors for any reason at any time, without prior notice, including in cases where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>an instructor or content does not comply with our policies or legal terms (including the Terms of Use)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>content falls below our quality standards or has a negative impact on the student experience</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>an instructor engages in behavior that might reflect unfavorably on Udemy or bring Udemy into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>an instructor uses the Services in a way that constitutes unfair competition, such as promotion of their off-site business in a way that violates Udemy's policies</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>as determined by Udemy in its sole discretion.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>3.2 Co-Instructors and Teaching Assistants</h5>
                    <p>The Udemy platform allows you to add other users as co-instructors or teaching assistants for Submitted Content that you manage, and you are required to comply with our Co-Instructor Relationship Rules and Guidelines when taking such actions. By adding a co-instructor or teaching assistant, you understand that you are authorizing them to take certain actions that affect your Udemy account and Submitted Content. Violations of Udemy's terms and policies by your co-instructor or teaching assistant may also impact your Udemy account and Submitted Content. Udemy is not able to advise on any questions or mediate any disputes between you and such users. If your co-instructors have an assigned revenue share, their share will be paid out of your earned revenue share based on the ratios you have specified in your Course Management settings as of the date of the purchase.</p>
                    <h5>3.3 Relationship to Other Users</h5>
                    <p>Instructors don't have a direct contractual relationship with students, so the only information you'll receive about students is what is provided to you through the Services. You agree that you will not use the data you receive for any purpose other than providing your services to those students on the Udemy platform, and that you won't solicit additional personal data or store students' personal data outside the Udemy platform. You agree to indemnify Udemy against any claims arising from your use of students' personal data.</p>
                    <h5>3.4 Anti-Piracy Efforts</h5>
                    <p>We partner with anti-piracy vendors to help protect your content from unauthorized use. To enable this protection, you hereby appoint Udemy and our anti-piracy vendors as your agents for the purpose of enforcing copyrights for each of your content, through notice and takedown processes (under applicable copyright laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and for other efforts to enforce those rights. You grant Udemy and our anti-piracy vendors primary authority to file notices on your behalf to enforce your copyright interests.</p>
                    <p>You agree that Udemy and our anti-piracy vendors will retain the above rights unless you revoke them by sending an email to takedowns@udemy.com with the subject line: "Revoke Anti-Piracy Protection Rights" from the email address associated with your account. Any revocation of rights will be effective 48 hours after we receive it.</p>

                    <h4>4. Pricing</h4>
                    <h5>4.1 Price Setting</h5>
                    <p>When creating Submitted Content available for purchase on Udemy, you will be prompted to select a base price ("Base Price") for your Submitted Content from a list of available price tiers. Alternatively, you may choose to offer your Submitted Content for free. As a premium instructor, you will also be given the opportunity to participate in certain promotional programs under the terms of our Promotions Policy ("Promotional Programs").</p>
                    <p>If you do not opt to participate in any Promotional Programs, we will list your Submitted Content for the Base Price or the closest local or mobile app equivalent (as detailed below). If you opt to participate in a Promotional Program, we may set a different discounted price or list price for your Submitted Content as described in the Promotions Policy.</p>
                    <p>When a student purchases using a foreign currency, we will convert the relevant Base Price or Promotional Program price into the student's applicable currency using a system-wide foreign currency conversion rate set by Udemy and fixed periodically into a table of corresponding price tiers by currency ("Price Tier Matrix"). Since the Price Tier Matrix is fixed, those conversion rates may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect when a transaction is processed. We reserve the right to update the Price Tier Matrix at any time. The Price Tier Matrix and additional information on Udemy's pricing tiers are available</p>
                    <p>When a student purchases through a mobile application, the mobile platform provider's pricing matrix will control, and we will choose the price tier closest to the applicable Base Price or Promotional Program price. Because mobile platforms impose their own currency conversion rates, conversions for mobile app prices may not match the conversions in the Price Tier Matrix.</p>
                    <p>You give us permission to share your Submitted Content for free with our employees, with selected partners, and in cases where we need to restore access to accounts who have previously purchased your Submitted Content. You understand that you will not receive compensation in these cases.</p>
                    <h5>4.2 Transaction Taxes</h5>
                    <p>If a student purchases a product or service in a country that requires Udemy to remit national, state, or local sales or use taxes, value added taxes (VAT), or other similar transaction taxes ("Transaction Taxes"), under applicable law, we will collect and remit those Transaction Taxes to the competent tax authorities for those sales. We may increase the sale price at our discretion where we determine that such taxes may be due. For purchases through mobile applications, applicable Transaction Taxes are collected by the mobile platform (such as Apple's App Store or Google Play).</p>
                    <h5>4.3 Promotional Programs</h5>
                    <p>Udemy offers several optional marketing programs (Promotional Programs) in which you can choose to participate, as detailed in our Promotions Policy. These programs can help increase your revenue potential on Udemy by finding the optimal price point for your Submitted Content and offering them through subscriptions collections.</p>
                    <p>There is no up-front cost to participate in these programs, and you can modify your participation status at any time, though changes you make will not apply to currently active campaigns and certain programs may have additional requirements on termination.</p>
